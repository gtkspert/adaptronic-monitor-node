Adaptronic Monitoring using Node.JS

This is written using Node.js v0.5.0 (old - sorry!)

First off, apologies for the uglyness of the code. This is my first go at a node.js app.

main.js contains the server used to query the ecu, inject modbus requests, and multicast datapoints.

hud.js is a console based monitor, which lists all the current raw values (soon to be the actual values)



ecu-datapoints.js contains the datapoint definitions for this ecu, including a math definition to divide/multiply the raw data by.

Adler32.js is a javascript function used to ensure that the multicasted JSON string is correct (given it's a UDP packet)

ecumanager.js contains the class to send and recieve commands to and from the ecu.

multicast.js contains the class to send the multicast commands to your endpoint.
